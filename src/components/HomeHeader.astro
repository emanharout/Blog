    But my desire to learn goes beyond programming. This site is where I share whatever sparks my curiosity. I'm all
    about embracing a wide range of interests, even in the face of conventional wisdom that says we should
    specializeâ€”especially in an age where the internet provides us instant access to the vast depths of human knowledge.
