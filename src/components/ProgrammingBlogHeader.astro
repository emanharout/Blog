    Welcome to my programming blog. While iOS and Swift take center stage, I also explore JavaScript, modern web
    development, and whatever else piques my curiosity.
</p>
<br />
<p>Above all, this blog is about embracing best practices, regardless of language or platform.</p>
<br />
<p>
    We will explore principles like SOLID and CLEAN code while discovering solutions that are functional, maintainable,
    and scalable. I dive into the trade-offs of various approaches, seeking clarity on when and why certain solutions
    work best. My hope is that you'll leave with insights you can apply to your own projects.
